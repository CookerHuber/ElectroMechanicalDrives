# ElectroMechanicalDrives

Modelica library for the simulation of electromechanical drives such as
- Electric vehicles
- Electric trains
- Machine tools
in order to investigate the stastionary and transient behaviour and to dimension electric drive components. 

The library provides: 
- Vehicle with
  - Aerodynamic friction 
  - Rolling friction
  - Inclincation of road
  - Optional electrical drive
- Linear, symmetric and chargable battery model, parameterized by cut off voltage, charge voltage, energy
- Ideal DC/DC converter with no loss
- Simplified DC machine model with field weakening capability
- Ideal mechanical machines with field weakening capabilites 
- Translational and rotational friction models
- Translational and rotational constant friction models
